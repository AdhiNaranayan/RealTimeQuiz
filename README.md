Assessment Task: Real-Time Quiz Application

We are excited to present you with a coding task that will allow you to demonstrate your skills in a practical scenario. The task involves building a real-time quiz application with the following modules:

1. Lobby:
Create a lobby that displays a list of available rooms. Each room should accommodate a maximum of two users before the game can start. If no rooms are available, the system should allow the creation of a new room and addition of a user.

2. Matchmaking:
Develop a matchmaking feature that enables users to join rooms with vacant slots. A user can join only one room at a time.

3. Gameplay:
Implement the gameplay mechanics. Randomly select 5 questions from a predefined list of questions and answers. Both users in a room should receive the questions one by one in real-time. Each user has a 10-second window to respond with their answers. The scoring system awards 10 points for correct answers.

4. Game Conclusion:
End the game after collecting responses for 5 questions or after 50 seconds, whichever comes first. Broadcast the result to both users. Once the game concludes, the respective room should be closed and deleted.

Technical Guidelines:
Utilize Express and SocketIO to create the necessary REST APIs and manage socket connections. You can choose a preferred database to store the game state of each room.

Creativity and Bonus:
Feel free to add your creative flair to the task. If you have innovative ideas to enhance the functionality or user experience, you are welcome to include them.

Timeframe:
The task is expected to be completed within 3 days.
